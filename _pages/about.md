This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!

I'm a last year (hopefully XD) Ph.D. student in [Prof. Christian Wagner](https://christianwagner.weebly.com/)'s  Group, at School of Computer Science, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK. I'm also a member of [LUCID](https://www.lucidresearch.org/members). Prior to UoN, I'm a research assistant in [Prof. Hisao Ishibuchi](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=hisao&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=2&lang=en)'s Group. I received my bachelor degree and master degree from Shijiazhuang University and Jiangnan University, respectively.  My research interests are causal learning, fuzzy systems and explainable artificial intelligent (XAI).
