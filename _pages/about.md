I'm a last year (hopefully XD) Ph.D. student in [Prof. Christian Wagner](https://christianwagner.weebly.com/)'s  Group, at School of Computer Science, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK. I'm also a member of [LUCID](https://www.lucidresearch.org/members). Prior to UoN, I'm a research assistant in [Prof. Hisao Ishibuchi](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=hisao&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=2&lang=en)'s Group. I received my bachelor degree and master degree from Shijiazhuang University and Jiangnan University, respectively.  My research interests are causal learning, fuzzy systems and explainable artificial intelligent (XAI).

# Research
My research interests are causal discovery, XAI, multi-view learning and fuzzy systems. Currently, I focus on how to use the causality between different variables to generate rules with highly explainability.
